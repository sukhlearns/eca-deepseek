  "question": "Garment Construction, Features, and Function",
  "answer": "Your NFPA 1971 Compliant Garment helps protect firefighters against heat and flame in three ways:\n1. It provides limited insulation from temperature extremes.\n2. It is made of special heat and flame-resistant textiles that char instead of melt or combust.\n3. Its thickness contributes to insulation.\n\nThe garment consists of three primary layers: an outer shell, a moisture barrier, and a thermal liner. The inner liner is removable for cleaning, inspection, and decontamination, and it must always be worn.\n\nThe outer shell fabric is made from self-extinguishing fibers with limited resistance to heat, flame, and abrasion. To self-extinguish, the fabric must be removed from the source of ignition.\n\nThe inner liner consists of a moisture barrier and a thermal barrier, protecting against moisture while allowing body heat to escape. The thermal barrier insulates from extreme heat.\n\nDifferent manufacturers offer fabrics with various characteristics. Your Fire Department selects a combination of fabrics that meet NFPA-compliant performance standards.\n\nYour garment includes an integrated Drag Rescue Device (DRD) for rescue operations, allowing for dragging in a way that minimizes further injury.\n\nAdditionally, the garment features a raised collar, closure systems, retroreflective trim for visibility, reinforcements for extra protection, and inspection systems for the inner liner.\n\n**Warnings:** Burns are a function of time and temperature, so be aware of heat buildup in your environment and garment to prevent burns.

  "question": "Proper Overlap and Fit of Garment",
  "answer": "Several different styles of NFPA 1971 Compliant Garments (coats and trousers) are available from LION and various other manufacturers. Make sure your coat and trousers are compatible to avoid severe burns, cuts, or abrasions to your lower back and torso. If you're unsure, contact LION for more information.\n\nWARNING: Ensure adequate overlap between the coat and trousers, including the outer shell, thermal liner, and moisture barrier before using the Garments. You will need a partner to check these key areas.\n\n**A Firefighter’s Height Affects Overlap**: Firefighters taller than 5’8\" (1.73 meters) MUST wear a coat that is at least 32\" (81 cm) from the back of the neck at the collar to the bottom of the coat hem. Long-bodied firefighters of any size should pay special attention to overlap requirements.\n\nTo check overlap, perform the following tests while wearing your complete protective ensemble, but without SCBA:\n\n- **NFPA 1500 Standard Position A**: While standing, reach overhead as high as possible with your hands together. The inner liner of the coat must overlap the trousers by no less than 2 inches (5 cm).\n\n- **NFPA 1500 Standard Position B**: While standing with hands together and reaching overhead, bend forward at a 90-degree angle to the left or right, and backward. The inner liner of the coat must overlap the trousers by no less than 2 inches (5 cm).\n\nDuring and after doffing, look for signs of chemicals, body fluids, or other contamination, and for signs of wear or damage. Check for signs of superheated gear, such as dye burning off that may appear as steam, and discoloration of PPE elements.\n\nDANGER: Avoid compressing superheated gear, as this may cause steam burns. If necessary, hold your arms out and have someone roll the coat off your arms.\n\nThe lower edges of your trousers should overlap the tops of your boots by 4-6 inches (10-15 cm). Gloves and wristlets must overlap by 3 inches (7.5 cm) without exposing wrists.\n\nAll Garments should have enough looseness in the torso, arms, and legs to maintain insulated air spaces. If the Garment bunches or binds, it may be too small. Garments shouldn’t be too loose either, as this could hinder mobility. Test the mobility by climbing stairs and crawling.\n\nCoat sizes should never be smaller than your chest circumference under your arms. Coats have an 8-10 inches (20-25 cm) overage for a better fit over clothing. For example, a \"size 44\" coat will measure 52-54 inches (132-137 cm) around the chest.\n\nTrousers should fit similarly, with a waist size that is never smaller than your own waist circumference. Ensure the lower edges of trousers overlap the tops of your boots.\n\nDANGER: Never wear a Garment that fits improperly. If there’s a fit issue, contact your safety officer for assistance. Improper fit can reduce protection and increase injury risk.\n\nCheck your Drag Rescue Device (DRD) for proper installation and make sure it doesn’t bind or limit your range of motion. If you feel tightness, remove the coat, check for twisting webbing, adjust the DRD, and recheck the fit.",

  "question": "Using Your Hood Safely: How to Minimize the Risk of Injury",
  "answer": "Before starting any emergency operation involving fire, ensure your hood is donned properly. Always wear clean and thoroughly dry hoods during structural firefighting operations, as soiled or contaminated hoods may become combustible and cause serious burns.\n\nFires are dangerous and unpredictable, with temperatures that can exceed 2000° F (1093° C) in seconds. Understanding these conditions is vital for maximizing your protection and recognizing the limitations of your hood against various fire hazards.\n\nThere are three types of heat transfer that can cause burns: \n- **Conduction**: Direct heat transfer through contact with a hot object. \n- **Convection**: Heat transfer through a medium, like air. \n- **Radiation**: Heat transfer in the form of light energy.\n\nBurns depend on the temperature of the heat source and the exposure duration. For example: \n- FIRST DEGREE BURNS start at 118° F (47.8° C). \n- SECOND DEGREE BURNS occur at approximately 131° F (55° C). \n- THIRD DEGREE BURNS occur around 152° F (66.7° C).\n\nHeat stress can significantly contribute to firefighter injuries. Working in hot environments raises your body temperature. To combat this, your heart beats faster to circulate blood to the skin. Regular cardiovascular exercise, proper training, a healthy diet, and avoiding obesity can reduce the risk of heart attacks.\n\nDuring firefighting, your heart rate increases to supply blood to working muscles. The adrenaline rush during emergencies can elevate your heart rate further, increasing the risk of heart attacks.\n\nIt’s important to note that your NFPA 1971 compliant hood lacks a moisture barrier, offering no protection against common fireground chemicals. Always use appropriate protective gear when dealing with liquid or vapor hazardous materials. Additionally, exposure to smoke particulates from combustion may negatively impact cardiovascular health.",
